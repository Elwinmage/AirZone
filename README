---------------------------------------------------
Be sure you can access your AirZone localy:

     wget -qO - --post-data '{"systemid":1}' http://<YOUR_IP>:3000/api/v1/hvac

     If you have not wget, enter the following url in your browser:

     http://<YOUR_IP>:3000/api/v1/integration

     if you see "{"errors":[{"error":"Method not provided or not supported"}]}" it's working!
     
   
Enter your AirZone IP and let the plugin auto-discover your system.
You can get temperature and humidity, change SetPoint, change mode, set on/off for each zone.
A global command as been implemented to change mode and to switch on/off.
